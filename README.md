# Gopher Buddy Blocker

### What is Gopher Buddy?
Gopher Buddy is a chrome extension that school boards in Canada and MAYBE some of the US uses to monitor their students online presence, Gopher Buddy sends the School board some information that is from your Chromebook (if your school does that) and it cannot be removed due to it being installed by an "organization".

### What does Gopher Buddy Track?
Gopher Buddy tracks many things for "analytics", when it's mainly going to the school board to monitor their students as they browse the world wide web, which is how they detect you on a website that is "not age appropriate" (Pornhub, XVideos, Pirating Sites, etc). Personally I think it's impressive how the school can keep it under our noses.<br><br>

What information does it track:<br>
- Local & Public IP addresses<br>
- Chromebook's Serial<br>
- Username of the computer<br>
- Web history<br>
- Session duration in minutes<br>
- Start time<br><br>

### How does Students not know what it is?
Well for most students, Gopher Buddy seems to just be a "ChromeOS Updater" even tho its not and it is just tracking your data, which is why when it said "your organization has required you to update the Chromebook in x amount of hours" it's not just because there is a legitimate update to the firmware, it's also giving Gopher Buddy the chance to send it to the school boards.

### Installation
To install this extension is a bit weird so get ready!<br><br>

2. When its downloaded go to your browser and type in the following URL that corresponds to your browser<br>
Chrome: chrome://extensions<br>
Brave: brave://extensions OR chrome://extensions<br>
Microsoft Edge: edge://extensions OR chrome://extensions<br>
AVG Secure Browser: secure://extensions OR chrome://extensions<br>
The reason why I chose these browsers specifically as they all are based on the chromium engine<br><br>

3. When you are on one of those extensions links toggle developer mode *this is until we add it to web stores* (using Chrome for this guide)<br>

4. When that's enabled make sure you press "Load unpacked"<br>

5. When the file explorer opens go to where you saved it (make sure to extract the .zip before-hand) and press "Select Folder"<br>

6. When you have selected it, the extension should appear in your list like this, if it looks like that, you have did it successfully and you may now use your chromebook like normal! without them tracking you<br>
